## Analysis of Genre
We go beyond just exploring genresâ€”we analyze their evolution and provide insights into the most popular genres over time. Our in-depth analysis tracks the growth and trends of each genre, allowing you to understand how musical landscapes have shifted and transformed throughout history.

## Prediction of Genre
One of the exciting features we offer is the prediction of genre trends. We utilize machine learning algorithms to predict what will be the trend of a genre over the years. This feature allows you to visualize the prediction of genre trends over time using different machine learning models and compare them with the actual data.
